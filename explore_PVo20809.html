                <h1>Explore marine life</h1>
                <p>Observing marine animals in their natural environment is a truly amazing experience. We all know that, but not all of us 
                can afford ocean expeditions. Thus, I provide you with the videos which are all credited to respective owners, so you can 
                learn fun facts about the marine life in your own time!</p>

                <h1>Tiger Shark</h1>
                <blockquote cite="https://oceana.org/marine-life/sharks-rays/tiger-shark">
                    <q>Tiger sharks are aggressive predators, famous for eating just about anything they find or are able to capture. They 
                    have been known to eat many different fishes and invertebrates, seabirds, sea turtles, some marine mammals, stingrays and 
                    other rays, smaller sharks, sea snakes, and scavenged dead animals, among other things. Several tiger sharks have been 
                    known to eat garbage, including metal, plastic, wood, fishing gear, and other trash. Though they are generalist predators, 
                    in some areas, tiger sharks likely specialize on certain highly available prey. For example, in Hawaii, tiger sharks are 
                    known to regularly attack and eat green turtles and hawaiian monk seals near the nesting beaches for those two species. 
                    Finally, tiger sharks have been known to bite people, and their rather large size leads to occasional fatalities, 
                    particularly in areas where large numbers of people use the ocean, recreationally.</q> - Oceana

                <h1>Killer Whale</h1>
                <blockquote cite="https://oceana.org/marine-life/marine-mammals/orca">
                    <q>Orcas get their nickname "killer whales" from their reputation of being ferocious predators, exhibiting almost hateful 
                    behaviors when toying with their prey. Interestingly, however, killer whales are actually very large dolphins, reaching lengths 
                    of 33 feet (10 m) and weights of at least 10 metric tones (22,000 pounds). Orcas and other dolphins are thought to be some of 
                    the smartest animals on the planet, challenging the great apes (chimps and gorillas) for the top spot. They are also extremely 
                    curious and often approach people to investigate. Their intelligence is likely both a result of and a driver of their complex 
                    social structures. They generally live in small groups and organize complex, group behaviors when mating and hunting. They are 
                    intelligent, playful, powerful animals – a worrisome combination if you happen to be their preferred prey. Different orca 
                    populations specialize on different prey types, including large bony fishes; seals, sea lions, and other large marine mammals; 
                    and penguins; among other things.</q> - Oceana

                <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/animal/piranha-fish">
                    <q>Piranha, also called caribe or piraya, any of more than 60 species of razor-toothed carnivorous fish of South American rivers 
                    and lakes, with a somewhat exaggerated reputation for ferocity. In movies such as Piranha (1978), the piranha has been depicted 
                    as a ravenous indiscriminate killer. Most species, however, are scavengers or feed on plant material. Most species of piranha 
                    never grow larger than 60 cm (2 feet) long. Colours vary from silvery with orange undersides to almost completely black. These 
                    common fishes have deep bodies, saw-edged bellies, and large, generally blunt heads with strong jaws bearing sharp, triangular 
                    teeth that meet in a scissorlike bite.</q> - The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica

                <h1>Lionfish</h1>
                <blockquote cite="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lionfish-facts.html">
                    <q>The lionfish, a longstanding showstopper in home aquariums, is a flourishing invasive species in U.S. Southeast and Caribbean 
                        coastal waters. This invasive species has the potential to harm reef ecosystems because it is a top predator that competes 
                        for food and space with overfished native stocks such as snapper and grouper. Scientists fear that lionfish will also kill off 
                        helpful species such as algae-eating parrotfish, allowing seaweed to overtake the reefs. In the U.S., the lionfish population 
                        is continuing to grow and increase its range. This is largely because lionfish have no known predators and reproduce all year 
                        long; a mature female releases roughly two million eggs a year.</q> -  National Ocean Service

                <blockquote cite="https://www.georgiaaquarium.org/animal/mandarinfish/">
                    <q>Mandarinfish are classified as a "dragonet" and is usually found in small groups spread over a small area. The vibrant colors 
                        of this species indicate to other animals that it is dangerous to consume. To make up for the lack of protective scales, the 
                        mandarinfish’s body produces an odorous, foul-tasting, toxic mucus. Sexually dimorphic, like other dragonets: male and female 
                        are physically dissimilar. Male is larger and exhibits a longer, spined dorsal fin that it uses for display. Popular aquarium 
                        fish but possibly difficult to feed. Only recommended for advanced aquarists.</q> -  Georgia Aquarium

                <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.mba.ac.uk/fact-sheet-cuttlefish">
                    <q>Cuttlefish are molluscs (related to snails and clams) and along with squid, nautilus and octopus make up the group called 
                        cephalopods, meaning ‘head foot’. All species in this group have tentacles attached to their head. The brain of a cuttlefish 
                        is enormous compared to other invertebrates (animals without a backbone) enabling cuttlefish to learn and remember. Despite 
                        being colour blind, they have very good eyesight and can vary their colour, shape and movement rapidly to communicate or 
                        camouflage. Cuttlefish produce clouds of ink when they feel threatened. This ink was once used by artists and writers (sepia).
                        Cuttlefish are skillful colour-changers. From birth, young cuttlefish can already display at least thirteen types of 
                        body pattern.</q> -  The Marine Biological Association
