                Observing marine animals in their natural environment is a truly amazing experience. We all know that, but not all of us 
                can afford ocean expeditions. Thus, I provide you with the videos which are all credited to respective owners, so you can 
                learn fun facts about the marine life in your own time!

                <h1>Tiger Shark</h1>
                <blockquote cite="https://oceana.org/marine-life/sharks-rays/tiger-shark">
                    <q>Tiger sharks are aggressive predators, famous for eating just about anything they find or are able to capture. They 
                    have been known to eat many different fishes and invertebrates, seabirds, sea turtles, some marine mammals, stingrays and 
                    other rays, smaller sharks, sea snakes, and scavenged dead animals, among other things. Several tiger sharks have been 
                    known to eat garbage, including metal, plastic, wood, fishing gear, and other trash. Though they are generalist predators, 
                    in some areas, tiger sharks likely specialize on certain highly available prey. For example, in Hawaii, tiger sharks are 
                    known to regularly attack and eat green turtles and hawaiian monk seals near the nesting beaches for those two species. 
                    Scientists often observe individuals with missing flippers that have been bitten off by a Tiger. At other island groups, 
                    tiger sharks are known to congregate near seabird rookeries during the times when young birds are learning to fly (and often 
                    end up on the sea surface). Finally, tiger sharks have been known to bite people, and their rather large size leads to occasional 
                    fatalities, particularly in areas where large numbers of people use the ocean, recreationally.</q> - oceana.org

                <h1>Killer Whale</h1>
                <blockquote cite="https://oceana.org/marine-life/marine-mammals/orca">
                    <q>Orcas get their nickname "killer whales" from their reputation of being ferocious predators, exhibiting almost hateful 
                    behaviors when toying with their prey. Interestingly, however, killer whales are actually very large dolphins, reaching lengths 
                    of 33 feet (10 m) and weights of at least 10 metric tones (22,000 pounds). Orcas and other dolphins are thought to be some of 
                    the smartest animals on the planet, challenging the great apes (chimps and gorillas) for the top spot. They are also extremely 
                    curious and often approach people to investigate. Their intelligence is likely both a result of and a driver of their complex 
                    social structures. They generally live in small groups and organize complex, group behaviors when mating and hunting. They are 
                    intelligent, playful, powerful animals – a worrisome combination if you happen to be their preferred prey. Different orca 
                    populations specialize on different prey types, including large bony fishes; seals, sea lions, and other large marine mammals; 
                    and penguins; among other things.</q> - oceana.org

                <h1>Piranha</h1>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/animal/piranha-fish">
                    <q>Piranha, also called caribe or piraya, any of more than 60 species of razor-toothed carnivorous fish of South American rivers 
                    and lakes, with a somewhat exaggerated reputation for ferocity. In movies such as Piranha (1978), the piranha has been depicted 
                    as a ravenous indiscriminate killer. Most species, however, are scavengers or feed on plant material. Most species of piranha 
                    never grow larger than 60 cm (2 feet) long. Colours vary from silvery with orange undersides to almost completely black. These 
                    common fishes have deep bodies, saw-edged bellies, and large, generally blunt heads with strong jaws bearing sharp, triangular 
                    teeth that meet in a scissorlike bite.</q> - The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica
